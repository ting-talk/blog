如何写一封能收到回复的开发信？

<!-- more -->



## 方法



### 内容

这封邮件对客户有什么帮助？这是一个值得深思的问题。

- Background research 的时间要充足，才能打动高质量的潜在客户。
- 放弃模板，例如 To whom it may concern（敬启者）；对邮件进行私人订制。
- 第一封开发信，不是以卖东西为目的。真诚些，摒弃虚头巴脑的话术，用专业知识展示对客户的价值并建立联系。



**切入点**

- 从哪里得到客户的信息
- 我是谁，来自哪个公司
- 公司是做什么产品的（针对客人用得上的产品）
- 产品参数
- 产品的优势：专利、证书或者畅销的市场
- 合作过的大客户：供货能力和质量以及信誉上没问题
- 设计开发能力：能够满足他们的需求
- 诉求处理速度：表明合作有效率
- 交货时间以及付款方式
- 新客户的优惠以及能够给予哪些支持



### 行文

#### 拼写

出现错别字，是不能容忍的，让收件人看到你的细心。

- 注意专有名词的写法，发送之前检查一遍错别字和语法。
- 使用 [英文标点符号](https://TingTrade.me/style-guide/)，并在后面空一格（括号首尾空一格）。



#### 简单

客户「扫描」邮件的时间只有几秒钟，用通俗的英文（plain English）帮助客户聚焦你要传达的内容。不要「秀英文」，Keep it short & simple. 因为收件人的母语不一定是英语。

> We supply tomatoes for MyLife Inc. with high quality and competitive price. Hope to cooperate with you! （句子简单，但内容空泛）

还有，一封邮件一个主题内容。说不完的话，在末尾留个尾巴，不让下一封邮件无话可说，或没话找话说。



#### 排版

- 不用衬线体（sans-serif），多用非衬线体，例如 Arial。
- 不要花花绿绿的颜色，只留黑色（加粗），灰色（正文）和品牌色。
- 用 CAPITAL（大写）或**加粗**显示需要强调的信息，例如你的产品。
  LARGEST BUYER of Smartphone
- 使用列表（Ordered List or Unordered List）陈述 3 到 6 个 USP（Unique Selling Point）
  - TWO SWAROVSKI LICENCES.
  - Jewelleries made with Swarovski crystals, sterling silver 925, zirconia and pearl.
  - More than 120 new arrivals monthly, as well as 15,000 available designs.
  - NO nickle, lead and cadmium (REACH No. 1907/2006)

####  语气

根据客户的语言风格调整自己的内容，客户喜欢寒暄就跟着问候，喜欢单刀直入就要言简意赅。



**语气委婉**

Could you please help to give me a reply today?

**多用被动语态**

被动语态：既定的事实和一些已经达成的决定。突出特点，表现专业性。
✔️ Samples will be sent to you tomorrow.

主动语态：释放情感，展示温度，比如说写延期邮件的时候，用主动语态才更能体现出你的歉意和真诚。
❌ We'll send you the samples tomorrow.







### 其他

- 用公司的企业邮箱或国外邮箱（Outlook、Gmail……）。

- 发邮件的时间选在客户当地的上班时间（借助定时发送功能）。
- 第一次联系客人的时候尽量使用纯文本格式，不要出现图片、链接和附件（防 Spam）。
- 工作邮件少用 `I`、`my`、`me`，多用 `we`、`us`。



## 主题

**假设**
- `TingTrade Inc. ` 我的公司，卖番茄（Tomato）的。
- `MyLife Inc.` 我的（My）老客户，美国第二大番茄零售商。
- `NewLife Inc.` 潜在的新（New）客户。



**通用模板**

`NewLife Inc. / MyLife Inc. Vendor - Tomato / TingTrade Inc`

- `NewLife Inc.` 提及潜在客户的公司名，表示这不是群发邮件。
- `MyLife Inc. Vendor - Tomato` 表明我们是美国第二大番茄零售商的供应商。
- `TingTrade Inc` 表明发件人是谁。



**随着内容更换**

去掉多余的 Re。

1. Re: School Bag Offer - 20170314
2. Re: Sale Note for School Bag + 合同号
3. Re: School Bag - ready for shipment.





**其他 Subject**

- 到客户网站上找素材  
  假设网站标语 / 核心价值 / 总裁致辞是 `Secure Your Daily Work`。Subject 可以是: Secure Your Daily Work, can we involve?  
  
- 以客户利益为目标，越具体越好  
  NewLife Inc. - Economy safety products get revenue 20% up - TingTrade Inc.
  
- 以主打产品为标题，一目了然  
  Purchasing - Featured products / Safetyvests - TingTrade Inc.
  Hot-Selling Jewelry from VIP Customer of SWAROVSKI
  
- 以市场信息为标题  
  TingTrade Inc.: Nonwoven material rise in April
  
- 直接表明意图  
  How could we be your possible vendor - TingTrade Inc.

Hi Jadon,

Tim from `***` China. Hope this email finds you well.

Consolidating your purchases from China has never been easier, we have completed numerous projects in Europe and you may even know some of the brands we've worked with.

There are a wide range of variety of `***` can be offered for your budget. What will the sound of your brand be? Find me on WhatsApp: `+86 *** **** ****` and let's discuss more.

Best regards,

Tim

Hi Jadon,

Tim again. Last time I mentioned we can offer the `***`.

Trust you're very busy, but I've been wanting to have a quick chat about bringing `***` presentation to you.

If 10 minutes of your time isn't too much to ask, then maybe we could jump on a quick call to discuss this?

Best regards,

Tim



---



Hi Jadon,

Based upon your `***` you're a big fan of `***`, inspiring me to reach out to you again.

You know we have been also authorized to produce some `***` for `***`.

Please see attached the photos for your reference.

Best regards,

Tim

Hi Jadon,

Good day.

I'd like to share you with the inspection report for 20 kinds of `***` shipped recently.

Thank you for taking the time to read my email. Really hope we cross paths in future.

Best regards,

Tim

Hi Jadon,

Thanks for your feedback.

Many of our current customers have used different suppliers in the past. Despite how much I really want your business, I'm sincerely happy for you & your company and how your vendors have performed.

When struggling to overcome delivery, prices etc challenges, please come to us for a quote or solution. You can always depend on our quality service.

I will keep updating you our new arrival of `***` if it will not bother you.

Best regards,

Tim



I'm happy that you have a good relationship with your current vendor already. Does they bring you 100% the results you are expecting or are there still areas where value can be added?



At this point, I'm not asking you to rip anything out. We'd just like the opportunity to show you how we're different and how we've provided additional value to our clients. I can present you some case we've done for our other clients.



Have they ever let you down? Are you looking for a more reliable supplier you can have confidence in. If possible, we can schedule a follow up call



It sounds like things are pretty good. Is there anything that you think could or should be better? 



Thanks for your information. We'd like to be your backup if you don't mind. Any inquiry or requirements, you can get the prompt attention from us.

#### BD Email 2.0

> Subject: Re: Trader Joe's - promotional ceramic mugs - TingTrading 

Hi Tim, 

Glad to hear that you are in the market for ceramic mugs. 

This is Jadon from TingTrading in China. We mainly export these items to the US market and have full experience in OEM for heavy branded customers like Pepsi, Costa, and Heineken. 

Free samples with a catalog could be provided on request. 

Thanks and best regards, 
Jadon



#### BD Email 3.0

Brief Introduction 

- Subject: Re: Trader Joe's - promotional ceramic mugs - TingTrading 
- Subject: Catalog for ceramic mugs 
- Subject: Offer sheet in detail - TingTrading 
- Subject: Testing reports for FDA approval & Prop 65 
- Subject: Re: Photos for showroom & hot-selling items 
- Subject: Packaging info to reduce the unit cost
- Subject: Factory audit report by Intertek 
- Subject: Updated quote recap for a new selection of Fall 2019 



#### BD Email 4.0：Blade mail



使用 Blade Mail 解决以下痛点：

- 太多无关的废话
- 主题毫无亮点，或过于推销化
- 过于正式的行文
- 一眼看过去，无法抓住核心内容
- 通篇错误单词、错误句型、错误时态、错误语法
- 内容又臭又长
- 过多的缩写
- 缺乏定制化的群发邮件
- 没有具体的收件人
- 细节把控不够，邮件过于粗糙



开场白

- 把精心准备的信息放在附件里，然后吸引客户打开附件。
- 第一封邮件加附件可能被 Spam，可以故意忘记。客户也许会反问：「附件在哪呢？」，这个时候客户就上钩了。
