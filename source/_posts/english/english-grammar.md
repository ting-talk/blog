## 不定式

**表结果**
- I hurried to the railway station to find my train is gone.  
  ✔️ 我匆忙地赶到火车站（结果）却发现我的车已经出发了。  
  ❌ 我匆忙地赶到火车站，是为了发现我的车已经走了（目的）。  
- 🌰 A Pittsburgh-area woman with car trouble popped the hood of her vehicle to find squirrels had hidden more than 200 walnuts in the car's body.  
- 🌰 He survived to see the end of the war.



## 虚拟语气

英语分 3 种语气：

- **陈述语气**：陈述事实、提出看法或问题等。所说的是真的。
  I like this book the best.  
  If you get up earlier, you will be able to catch the first bus.
  
- **祈使语气**：表示请求、命令或警告等。希望所说的成真。
  Don’t be so careless. 

- **虚拟语气**：表示假想或主观愿望。所说的与事实不符。
  I suggest that we should go tomorrow.   
  If you dropped the glass, it would break.   



How to 虚拟语气：

- 以动词的过去式作为表达「非事实」的手段。
- 过去式并不是过去时。虚拟语气中的过去式只是一个表示虚拟语气的形式，而不是表示过去的时态的形式。



### 虚拟现在

- 条件从句的谓语：用过去式（be 用 were）
- 主句谓语：should / would / could / might + 动词原形

e.g. (example given)

- If I were you, I would not tell him the truth.
- If we left now, we should arrive in good time.



### 虚拟过去

因为时间本来就是过去，若还要用过去形态来表达非事实语气，就必须用过去完成的形态。

- 条件从句的谓语：had+ 过去分词
- 主句谓语：should / would / could / might + have+ 过去分词


e.g.
- If you had got up earlier, you would have caught the first bus.
- If he had been in that train then, he might have been killed in that accident. 



### 虚拟将来

- 条件从句的谓语：用过去式（be 用 were）
- 主句谓语：should / would / could / might + 动词原形

e.g.

- If he went, would you go too.
- If I asked him, I'm sure he'd help us. 
- 可能性特别低：should
  If I should win the lottery, I would buy you a car.
- 不可能发生：were to
  If I were to lie to her, I would lose her.



### Tips

- 倒装结构
  If I were a boy, I might be very handsome.   
  =   
  Were I a boy, I might be very handsome.  

- be 动词因虚拟语气变为过去式时只会变为 were，而永远不会变成 was。

- 混合时态会有一个明显的时间标识，例如 now
  If I had finished my work earlier, I could have dinner now.
  If you'd listened to me, you wouldn't be in such trouble now. 

- 混合语气
   I could have caught that bus, only that I forgot to get any money out.





## 特殊结构

- She was the only person to survive the air crash.
