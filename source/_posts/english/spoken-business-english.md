**Dialogue**

- 📕 OK， Mr. Fernando. Let me give you a brief introduction of our company.
- 📗 OK.
- 📕 Our company was established in 1988, so we have roughly 25 years’ experience in the lighting field. Originally, we only had a small factory with 20 people, with sales turnover (营业额) of only 13,000 USD. However, over the past 25 years, we have expanded rapidly. Now we have 300 workers in our own factory and 50 staff belonging to several teams in our trading company.
- 📗 I see. / Mmm hmm.
- 📕 And our business is still growing. The sales turnover last year was 10 billion US dollars for our solar lights and other lighting items.
- 📗 Impressive.
- 📕 Our products have been sold worldwide. Our primary markets are in the US, Germany, Canada, and Japan.
- 📗 `What is` / `How about` the percentage for your European market?
- 📕 Roughly 65% from Europe, 15% from the U.S., and he rest from other countries or regions.
- 📗 So, out of your existing orders from Europe what percentage comes from Italy?
- 📕 Honestly, we have no customer directly from Italy. But we do sell a lot of items to importers in Holland and Belgium, and maybe you could find our articles in the retail shops in Italy.
- 📗 In that case, maybe I’ll be your first client in Italy.
- 📕 We definitely hope so. And this is the chart for our turnover growth and current market share. The next page is the list for our testing certificates and reports, so you can get a rough idea.

### 边走边谈

- 📕 We don’t know yet. We plan to promote this item in the Canton Fair next spring.

- 📕 It’ll be based on quantity. If you could place one 20-foot container, the unit price could be 3.74 USD.
- 📗 How many pieces could be filled in the whole container?
- 📕 Roughly 8,000.
- 📗 Oh, that’s in excess of our needs. We would like to take in 500 to 1,000 pieces for trial.

- 📗 Sure. What about this one?
- 📕 Ah, we sold this model to Aldi for one million pieces last year.
- 📗 Wow. So you have very competitive pricing on this one, right?
- 📕 Yes, we do. But I have to know your quantity before giving you a final offer.
- 📗 One last question. Could you please take this one and the previous one to the boardroom table? We could go over them one by one some time later.
- 📕 Don’t worry. Just lay them aside on the floor. And we’ll collect them for your confirmation later.
- 📗 OK. Let’s go ahead.
- 📕 And this shelf includes our promotional items to the U.S.. All of them are packed by double blister with Ni-Cad battery.
