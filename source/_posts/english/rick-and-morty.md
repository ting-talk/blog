## Quotes

Rick: Listen Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people calls "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.

Rick：Morty，我不想这么直白地跟你说，但是所谓的「爱」呢，不过就是让动物繁衍后代的化学反应而已。开始让人头昏脑热，然后就慢慢消退，只留给你一段失败的婚姻。我就是这样，你父母也会这样。别重蹈覆辙，应该把精力放在科学研究上。）



You have to think ahead and live in the moment.

在活在当下的同时，也要思考未来（未雨绸缪）。



Your future stems from your present, which, if you're living right, keeps changing. Truth is, anyone that knows how they're definitely gonna die is either boring as hell or about to get shot. People that spend their life avoiding death are already dead (直视死亡，方能解脱).
